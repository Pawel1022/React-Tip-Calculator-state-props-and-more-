# 💰 Tip Calculator – React Mini Project

A small interactive React app to calculate how much you should tip based on how you and a friend rate the service.  
The app takes the bill amount, combines two tip percentages, and shows the total amount to pay – with an optional reset.

---

## ✨ Features

- Input the bill amount
- Select service rating from **you** and **your friend**
- Calculates **average tip percentage**
- Displays final amount = bill + tip
- Reset button to clear all values

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- React state management with `useState`
- Controlled form elements (`input`, `select`)
- Conditional rendering (only show message/reset if bill is entered)
- Lifting state up and passing props between components
- Basic math and rounding logic in components

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** – functional components + hooks
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – app logic
- No external libraries
- No styling (focus on logic & functionality)

## 🧾 Example

If the bill is `$80`, and you rated the service `10%` and your friend `20%`:  
→ Tip = 15% → Final total: **$92**
